What's benefits to use *immutable* data for HTML elements as `textarea`,
which by it's design should contain *mutable* data.

I am using `React.js` recently, but actually I keep using *mutable* object
if the data suppose to be *mutated*. Am I wrong?

As an example, let me show an `CommentEditor`:

    //...

    class CommentEditor extends React.Component{
        constructor(props){
        }
    }
